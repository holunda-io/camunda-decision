# camunda-decision-model-jackson

Uses jackson-xml-databind to read/write DMN 1.3 conform
decison-tables and -graphs.

This is A workaround that has to be used until the camunda
official model API supports DMN 1.3 correctly.

Focusses on the attributes required for decision tables 
and required decision tables, this is no feature complete
DMN/XML library.
